In Next.js, cookies are not automatically sent to the server via data fetching methods like getServerSideProps because these methods are executed on the server-side, and cookies are stored on the client-side. This means that if you're making a request from getServerSideProps, it will not have access to the client's cookies by default, and the request will be sent with an empty cookie.

Although, we can set the client's cookies in getServerSideProps by extracting them from the incoming request headers. Whenever a user requests a page from the browser, the request is sent to the frontend server where the Next.js application is running. The server then builds the initial HTML and executes getServerSideProps. At this point, Next.js inject context parameter to getServerSideProps that contains information about the incoming request, including the request object, response object, query parameters, and more. We can access the browser request headers and extract the cookies from there. Once we have the cookies, we can set them explicitly in any further request made from getServerSideProps.
